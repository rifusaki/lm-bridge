# lm-bridge

This small project will contain the source code to send messages from a WhatsApp chat as prompts to ChatGPT and return its response without the need of an OpenAI API key. It's more of a personal project. However as of today it's still an echo bot lmao

- `src` - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

### Resources

This app requires you to have access to the [WhatsApp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started).
